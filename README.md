# TRINETRA — AI-Powered Ransomware Defense System

> An intelligent, multi-agent cybersecurity system designed to detect ransomware activity, assess risk, and coordinate automated response.

TRINETRA is a cybersecurity project that combines machine learning, Python-based backend agents, and a desktop command center to provide a unified view of ransomware detection, risk assessment, containment, and recovery.

The system is being developed as a functional prototype, with the goal of building a more complete endpoint security and automated response platform.

---

## Overview

Ransomware attacks can encrypt files, disrupt systems, and cause significant data loss.

TRINETRA is designed to address this problem through a coordinated workflow:

- Monitor suspicious system activity.
- Identify potentially malicious behavior.
- Assess the level of risk.
- Decide whether a response is required.
- Contain the threat.
- Support recovery of affected files.

The system uses six specialized agents that work together rather than relying on a single detection component.

## How TRINETRA Works

The proposed workflow is:

```text
System Activity
      ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│ WATCHDOG              │
│ Monitors activity     │
│ and detects signals   │
└───────────┬───────────┘
            ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│ GATEKEEPER            │
│ Filters and validates │
│ suspicious activity   │
└───────────┬───────────┘
            ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│ RISK ANALYSER         │
│ ML-based risk         │
│ assessment            │
└───────────┬───────────┘
            ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│ POLICY ENGINE         │
│ Decides the response  │
│ according to policy   │
└───────────┬───────────┘
            ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│ VAULTKEEPER           │
│ Supports file         │
│ protection and        │
│ recovery              │
└───────────┬───────────┘
            ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│ ENFORCER              │
│ Executes containment  │
│ actions               │
└───────────────────────┘
```

### Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Watchdog** | Monitors system activity and identifies suspicious behavior. |
| **Gatekeeper** | Filters and validates activity before it moves further through the workflow. |
| **Risk Analyser** | Uses the ransomware detection model to assess the risk associated with the observed activity. |
| **Policy Engine** | Evaluates the risk assessment and determines the appropriate response according to the configured policy. |
| **Vaultkeeper** | Handles the protection and recovery side of the system, including recovery-related operations. |
| **Enforcer** | Executes the response actions required to contain the threat. |

The agents are designed to work in coordination, allowing detection, decision-making, containment, and recovery to be handled as connected stages of the same workflow.

---

## Machine Learning Component

The Risk Analyser uses a **Random Forest classification model** developed for ransomware risk analysis.

The model is trained to identify patterns associated with ransomware behavior and provide a risk assessment that can be used by the downstream policy and response workflow.

The ML component is one part of the larger system: the model provides the risk assessment, while the other agents handle the surrounding detection and response process.

---

## Desktop Application

TRINETRA also includes a desktop command center that provides a visual interface for interacting with the system.

The application is being developed using **Tauri**, with a React and TypeScript frontend.

### Current Desktop Features

- **Command Center** — A central dashboard for viewing system status, risk level, active agents, and security activity.
- **Live Monitor** — Displays live risk information, activity graphs, and event feeds.
- **Agent Network** — Provides an overview of the six agents and their current states.
- **Attack Replay** — Allows users to view the simulated attack and observe the response workflow.
- **Threat Alerts** — Displays alerts when a critical threat is detected.
- **Incidents** — Provides an interface for viewing and managing security incidents.
- **Files** — Provides access to file-related security operations.
- **Recovery** — Provides access to recovery-related operations.
- **Simulation Lab** — Supports testing and demonstrating the system's response workflow.
- **Reports** — Provides access to system reports.
- **Quick Actions** — Provides shortcuts for frequently used security operations.

## Project Status

**Current Stage: Functional Prototype / Active Development**

TRINETRA is currently being developed as a prototype to demonstrate the integration of machine learning, coordinated security agents, and a desktop command center.

The current implementation focuses on:

- Developing the Python backend and agent workflow.
- Integrating the ransomware risk analysis model.
- Connecting the detection, decision, containment, and recovery stages.
- Building the desktop command center.
- Testing the system through simulated ransomware scenarios.

The project is **not yet a production-ready endpoint security solution**.

Further development is required for areas such as broader real-world testing, deployment hardening, and production-level reliability.
